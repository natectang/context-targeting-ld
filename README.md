* Feature Flag: Implement a feature flag around a specific component. This can be the same
feature from your “release and remediate” example or a new one.
* Context Attributes: Create a context with attributes of your choosing; you will use these
attributes to target your feature release.
* Target: Demonstrate both individual targeting and rule-based targeting.
